        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission was to improve S√•ngv√§gen‚Äôs reputation by creating a welcoming 
          and vibrant digital platform that fosters a sense of safety, inclusion, and community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed in close collaboration with J√§rf√§llahus and local stakeholders as part of a real 
          client project during our studies at Chas Academy, the platform was informed by real user 
          insights and built by a cross-functional team of 11 students:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>üë©‚Äçüé® <strong>2 UX/UI designers</strong></li>
          <li>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>2 DevOps engineers</strong></li>
          <li>üíª <strong>7 fullstack developers (open source stack)</strong></li>
        </ul>

      <section id="problem" className="project-content">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          S√•ngv√§gen faced challenges with low engagement and a lack of clear, accessible communication channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The existing official website was too general and difficult to navigate, leaving residents disconnected from community activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our challenge was to build a simple, inviting platform that would improve the area's image by inspiring trust, 
          encouraging participation, and making local information easily accessible.
        </p>

      <section id="goals" className="project-content">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Create</strong> a visually appealing, intuitive platform consistent with J√§rf√§llahus branding but with a fresh, modern twist</li>
          <li><strong>Increase</strong> resident engagement by promoting local activities and enabling easy event registration.</li>
          <li><strong>Foster</strong> a stronger sense of community and inclusion across diverse user groups including families, youth, and seniors.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensure</strong> accessibility and ease of use, especially for less tech-savvy users.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="research" className="project-content">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted qualitative user interviews with residents of S√•ngv√§gen and the wider J√§rf√§lla area to understand perceptions 
          of safety, inclusion, and community involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          These insights revealed that transparency, accessible language, and mobile-friendly content were essential to reach a broad demographic.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the data, we identified three primary behavioral user types that shaped our design focus:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>üëÄ The Unaware</strong> ‚Äì low drive but responsive to clear, inspiring content; prefers traditional or passive channels</li>
          <li><strong>ü´Ä The Empathetic</strong> ‚Äì values inclusion and seeks participation in community-building events</li>
          <li><strong>‚òÄÔ∏è The Optimist</strong> ‚Äì hopeful and observant; engages more digitally, particularly via social platforms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These personas helped us prioritize clarity, engagement, and visual cues throughout the user journey.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="ideation" className="project-content">
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          Inspired by J√§rf√§llahus‚Äôs existing website, we retained core visual elements such as fonts and colors, 
          while introducing softer UI components to modernize and humanize the interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early wireframes emphasized intuitive navigation and accessibility for all age groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ideation process was highly collaborative, involving continuous feedback loops between UX designers, 
          fullstack developers, and DevOps engineers to ensure technical feasibility and user-centered design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="design" className="project-content">
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A clean</strong>, accessible interface with rounded corners for a softer look.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear</strong> CTA buttons for event registration and information browsing.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsive</strong> layouts optimized for both desktop and mobile.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual</strong> cues and feedback incorporated to guide users, especially seniors and digitally inexperienced residents.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="outcome" className="project-content">
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted both guerrilla usability tests in public spaces and structured user testing sessions with residents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feedback informed several design improvements, including clearer scroll cues, better button labeling, and simplified navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform was well received and appreciated for its clarity, friendliness, and relevance to everyday life in S√•ngv√§gen.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, the project contributed to a more approachable digital presence and gave residents better tools to connect with each other and their community.
